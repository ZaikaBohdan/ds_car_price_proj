    "[CarDekho](https://www.cardekho.com/) is India's leading car search venture that helps users buy cars. Its website and app carry rich automotive content such as expert reviews, detailed specs and prices, comparisons as well as videos and pictures of all car brands and models available in India. The company has tie-ups with many auto manufacturers, more than 4000 car dealers and numerous financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of vehicles.\n",

    "* kmpl - Kilometers Per Litre is a term use to express the fuel efficiency of a vehicle. Fuel efficiency is defined as the ratio of distance travelled per unit of fuel consumed.\n",
    "* СС - The term “cc” stands for Cubic Centimeters or simply cm³ which is a metric unit to measure the Engine's Capacity or its volume. Usually increase power of car.\n",
    "* bhp - Traditionally ‘brake horsepower’ (bhp) has been used as the definitive measurement of engine power. It’s distinct from horsepower because it takes into account power loss due to friction – it’s measured by running an engine up to full revs, then letting it naturally slow down to a dead stop.\n",
    "* nm at rpm - Torque is rotational force, and since an engine relies on a rotating crank to do its work, torque is the force the engine is able to generate. Modern engines generate different levels of torque at different engine speeds (RPMs, or revolutions per minute that the engine is turning through). It’s expressed in Newton-Metres (Nm), and this is what you actually feel when you’re pushed back into your seat on acceleration. A car brochure will indicate the maximum torque the engine is able to generate, and the specific RPM at which it is generated. For instance, the Maruti Dzire generates 113Nm at 4200RPM (petrol) and 190Nm at 2000RPM (diesel). This means the petrol engine produces less torque at a much higher engine speed than the diesel motor, which produces more at a quite low engine speed. The bottomline: Look for a good torque (over 110Nm) with a low RPM (4,000 or so).\n",
