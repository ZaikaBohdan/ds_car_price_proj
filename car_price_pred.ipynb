    "## About project\n",
    "[CarDekho](https://www.cardekho.com/) is India's leading car search venture that helps users buy cars. Its website and app carry rich automotive content such as expert reviews, detailed specs and prices, comparisons as well as videos and pictures of all car brands and models available in India. The company has tie-ups with many auto manufacturers, more than 4000 car dealers and numerous financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll collect data about used cars from CarDekho website and use it to build car price prediction model. This model may later be used by CarDekho for suggesting the price of posted by user used car."

    "\n",
    "Since we don't have access to the database of CarDekho website, there are two main ways to collect data: find existing datasets or scrape data from CarDekho website. Kaggle contains two useful for our case datasets: [Vehicle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=Car+details+v3.csv) (\\~8000 rows) and [Used Car Prices in India](https://www.kaggle.com/saisaathvik/used-cars-dataset-from-cardekhocom?select=Cardekho_Extract.csv) (\\~20000 rows). We will use this data for model building, because:\n",
    "* both datasets contain similar columns which will make it easy to union them;\n",
    "* in sum it is about 28000 rows, which is enough for model building;\n",
    "* using existing datasets takes less time than scraping new from website;\n",
    "* according to Kaggle, ~30% of used cars from [Vehicle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=Car+details+v3.csv) was bought in 2016-2020 and ~16% of used cars from [Used Car Prices in India](https://www.kaggle.com/saisaathvik/used-cars-dataset-from-cardekhocom?select=Cardekho_Extract.csv) was bought in 2018-2021. Therefore the data is fresh enough."

    "* Lakh - a unit in the Indian numbering system equal to one hundred thousand (100,000). In the Indian 2,2,3 convention of digit grouping, it is written as 1,00,000. For example, in India 150,000 rupees becomes 1.5 lakh rupees, written as ₹1,50,000 or INR 1,50,000.\n",
    "* kmpl - Kilometers Per Litre is a term use to express the fuel efficiency of a vehicle. Fuel efficiency is defined as the ratio of distance travelled per unit of fuel consumed. 1 km/kg = 1.4 kmpl\n",
    "* СС - The term “cc” stands for Cubic Centimeters or simply cm³ which is a metric unit to measure the Engine's Capacity or its volume. Usually increase power of car.\n",
    "* bhp - Traditionally ‘brake horsepower’ (bhp) has been used as the definitive measurement of engine power. It’s distinct from horsepower because it takes into account power loss due to friction – it’s measured by running an engine up to full revs, then letting it naturally slow down to a dead stop.\n",
    "* nm at rpm - Torque is rotational force, and since an engine relies on a rotating crank to do its work, torque is the force the engine is able to generate. Modern engines generate different levels of torque at different engine speeds (RPMs, or revolutions per minute that the engine is turning through). It’s expressed in Newton-Metres (Nm), and this is what you actually feel when you’re pushed back into your seat on acceleration. A car brochure will indicate the maximum torque the engine is able to generate, and the specific RPM at which it is generated. For instance, the Maruti Dzire generates 113Nm at 4200RPM (petrol) and 190Nm at 2000RPM (diesel). This means the petrol engine produces less torque at a much higher engine speed than the diesel motor, which produces more at a quite low engine speed. The bottom line: Look for a good torque (over 110Nm) with a low RPM (4,000 or so). 1 kgm = 9.80665 Nm"
