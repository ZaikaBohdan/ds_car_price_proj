    ## About the app
    This application is a part of the data science project ["Building a car price prediction model for the CarDekho website"](https://github.com/ZaikaBohdan/ds_car_price_proj). Through the "Navigation" in the sidebar, you can choose one of three options:
    1. 'Predict the price of one car': Manually enter vehicle characteristics to evaluate its price;
    2. 'Predict prices for a file with cars': Upload csv file with the characteristics of cars to evaluate their price. Two modes are available:
        * Input data with known price (for evaluating model performance)
        * Input data with unknown price (for evaluating car prices)
    3. 'Explore car prices': Explore selling prices in collected data with the help of visualizations.
